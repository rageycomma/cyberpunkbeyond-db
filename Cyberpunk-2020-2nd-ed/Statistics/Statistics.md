Statistics in Cyberpunk are the attributes of your character, describing their capabilities in a variety of traits. 

## Character Points

Character points are numerical values that are assigned to statistics.

## Statistic allocation

Statistics are numerical values, which range from 2 to 10, with 10 being best, and 2 being worst. The player has three options:

* **Random** - The player rolls <roll>9D10</roll> and adds them together, then allocates them between the statistics as they see fit.
* **Fast** - The player rolls <roll>1D10</roll> for each statistic (excluding RUN and LEAP) and uses that value (discarding any rolls below 2)
* **Cinematic** - The player selects from a pre-defined list of positions, similar to movie roles, depending upon the role the person wants to play in the game, and allocates them as they see fit.
  * Major Hero - 80 points
  * Minor Hero - 75 Points
  * Major Supporting Character - 70 points
  * Minor Supporting Character - 60 points
  * Average - 50 points
