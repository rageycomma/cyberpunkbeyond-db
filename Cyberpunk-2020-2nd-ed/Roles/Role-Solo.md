## About
Solos are augmented and jacked-up corporate killers who act as the muscle for corporate dealings.

They originated from government or corporate militaries who originally started as regular mercenaries, but quickly evolved into relying upon more hardware - Cyber Limbs for weapons and armor, and Bio-Program Chips for augmenting reflexes and reaction times. They eventually break from their corporate or government bonds, and become *Ronin*, self-styled freelance killers. 

Solos are known for being extremely wiry; jacked up to the max with all kinds of hardware and drugs, and unstable, living life from luxury one day to strung-out lives in the gutter the next.
