# Roles

**Edition**: Cyberpunk 2020, 2nd ed.

**Page Ref**: p4

In Cyberpunk, the player selects a *Role*, which is persona that the player plays as. This is the same as a *character class* in other tabletop games (Hunter, Cleric, etc.). Each *role* confers benefits and weaknesses. They are also referred to as *cyberpunks*.

The roles (cyberpunks) in Cyberpunk are:
