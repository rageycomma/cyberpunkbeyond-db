## About
Netrunners are the archetypical computer crackers. They learn from an early age to use technology and then move on to making their own with programming languages, cracking school computers, and and then as they grow older, turn their sights to more lucrative and challenging feats.They have a direct link to the computer, linking their brain literally to the Net, allowing them to seamlessly and sleekly slip through the Net -- Netrunning -- taking on corporations like EBM, ITT and Sony-Matsushita-Ford and governments alike.

They sometimes stumble upon corporate secrets and treachery, and are constantly seeking out new frontiers where they can ply their craft. But, this doesn't come without danger - with all their body jacked up to the Net, some other netrunner can come along and take them out, stopping their heart like killing a stuck process.
