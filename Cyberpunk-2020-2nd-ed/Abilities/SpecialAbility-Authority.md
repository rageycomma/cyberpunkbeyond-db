# Ability: Special - Authority
**Edition**: Cyberpunk 2020, 2nd ed.

**Page Ref**: p4, p46

**Applies to Role(s)**: Cop

## Description
Is the ability to intimidate others as a police officer, and call upon the forces of the law to get what they want, and bust bad guys. It provides the cop with the ability to enter wherever they want, detain or search, providing they have the warrants backing them up.

The more Authority a cop has, the more powerful the mobster and corrupt official the cop can bust.

However if the cop is unsure of his authority, it's more likely they'll get laughed at rather than complied with.
