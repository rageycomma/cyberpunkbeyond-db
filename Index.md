# Cyberpunk Reference

## [Cyberpunk 2020, 2nd ed](/Cyberpunk-2020-2nd-ed/Index.md)

## Note
Please note, to avoid copyright, the general gist of the information is provided here so we can actually have a reference of the game without everyone having to buy the book. This is purely done as a means of modernisation. I would *thoroughly* recommend buying the books here so that you can support Talsorian Games. That said, this project is purely done for the same of **modernising** Cyberpunk, and making it *accessible* to those insolent ones among us who want to play with Virtual Tabletops, and not pen & paper.
